# Projects in Applied Bioinformatics

## Neanderthal Mitochondrial DNA Analysis
Explored the Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA, comparing genes with Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and identifying unique genome features. Employed the seqshoworfs function, base distributions analysis, and a dimer count to study genome attributes.
## Protein Comparison in Microalgae and Humans
Investigated the similarity between the RING1 protein in unicellular microalgae and its human counterpart. Utilized the getgenpept function, dot plot visualization, and both local and global alignments with custom BLOSUM30 scoring matrices to determine protein similarities.
## Breast Cancer Cell Line Gene Expression Analysis
Analyzed a microarray dataset from the MCF7 breast cancer cell line to determine gene expression alterations due to oxygen deprivation. Applied data validation, normalization, microarray data distribution differentiation, and t-test statistics for differential expression identification.
## Beta-Corona Viruses Metadata Analysis
Analyzed metadata from beta-Corona Viruses samples sourced from Nextstrain. Imported and processed CSV data, downloaded sequences via genbank accession numbers, and calculated genetic distances with seqpdist. Further constructed and compared phylogenetic trees using seqlinkage and seqneighjoin to understand SARS-CoV2 evolution.
